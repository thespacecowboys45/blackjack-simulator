# Streak Betting Strategy
#
# Vary bet based on W/L streak
#
# Note, each column (or header) must be unique value
#
#
# R = RESET
# I = INCREASE
# D = DECREASE
# S = STAND
#
#
# This may get complex, as the intracacies of programming this
# matrix, along with whatever patterns may emerge amonst win/loss
# streaks
#
# Like, the first win after 'n' consecutive losses - you cannot just
# continue to increase, because if you lost this bet then...what?  
#  You fall back into the "first loss" column and forever keep
# increasing your bet, until you have 2 consecutive wins in a row.
#
# Also, I have witnessed somewhere near 30 as the "max" consecutive losses per round
# running 5000 games per round at 6-decks per game.
#
# And so, it gets complicated.
