# Learning Blocks

Code found in this folder was used to understand the rudimentary logic behind

some of the other programs.

For example - one of my programs uses a recursive function.  If you are not

familiar with this advances 1970's technology, then , as I did , learn about

how to write a simple recursive function which calculates an exponential

equation.  E.g. 2 to the 'n' power is what?

Programs:

1) recursive functions
2) converting a number in one base to another
