# Splitter

### A story by The Space Cowboy

Once upon a time there was a fork in the road.  A splitter if you would, and I'm not talking about one that spreads their legs in a middle of a casino kinda splitter.  YOU know the kind, no no no, this one, however is bigger than that in that it needs to split an infinite (or realllly large number of times).  And I am talking thus, given two points in the space apply an algoright to cut them in half, in a manner of speaking.  Wow, this is a really long sentence and there is no end in sight, and so thus shitter and splitter were borne again, and then there was one which was the tidy man.

That was a long ten sentences.

So, thus:

## Theory

We have a large dataset, to explore.  Apply binary tree logic to it, in order to segment the parts into manageable chunks.  THe idea is to take the whole game of possibilities, and to both go back and forth - like, do both projects, and so also - I mean, the first one and then the second one.  Proping the head up with the frosted look would be nice as especially it would go with lighter and darker colors in the art room.

A side discount could be applied, and anytime it could be determined to be large.

A large problemset.

Thus....
