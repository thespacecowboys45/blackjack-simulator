# BREAKING BLACKJACK

## A story by The Space Cowboy

Once upon a time, we thought to ourself....

```

Should we split?

```

And by spit or split, it is always a decision.  To spin the wheel of chance and wonder if it is beneficitial in our favor or against us is a quandry.

Not in the game of blackjack.

Let's compare our "we can split cards" versus our "we cannot split cards" strategies as far as "ending bankroll" is concerned.

```

Quite frankly , we loose less.

```

In certain situations, not winning is bad.  Not loosing "as bad" is good!  What do the pundits say?
